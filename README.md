Please make sure the folder in which the items you want to download is in the downloads folder.
This program assumes and is dependant on the fact that the destination of the file is in hard drive C: AND the Downloads folder.
Please note if the program encounters an error that you typed everything in properly.
Another note, please make sure the volumes can be arranged properly in numerical order. This is necessary for the program to work properly
Next note is that if the program crashes, and error probably happened so just restart it it's fine,
Second last note is that this isn't a file reformatter so don't try to change up the file type.
Last note is that this program doesn't take decimals into consideration - Only integers
Honestly there might be a few typos
