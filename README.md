This program is mainly to rename a series en masse

File should be in the C: hard drive if it isn't I don't know what I would do. It should also be in the downloads folder.
Also, Python sorting is weird so if the episode numbers go by 1, 2, ..., 10, ..., 100, it'll be weird since it's sorting by string so it'll go like 1, 10, 100, and all the files get all messed up.
